            saw a dust-bearing bee sink into the sanctum of a bloom; the thousand
            sister-calyxes arch to meet the love embrace and the ecstatic shiver of
            the tree from root to tiniest branch creaming in every blossom and
            frothing with delight. So this was a marriage! She had been summoned
            to behold a revelation" - Page 43 (PDF)</p>

          <p class="text-center text-wrap">There are many elements within this abstract image. The brown log-ish features seem to make up the tree that Janie refers to. The green textures surrounding the logs seem to make up the leaves and branches of the tree. Beyond that, there is a lot of interpretation to be had. The yellow spots in the image can be interpreted as the bees "sink[ing] into the sanctum of a bloom." I interpret the yellow spots, however, to be a form of light. We often associate happiness with light and sadness with darkness. Is it possible that happiness is Janie's form of love? The use of an exclamation point in "So this was a marriage!" further exemplifies this point. An exclamation point is often used to exclaim something, typically out of excitement or happiness. Marriage is a way that people express love and happiness can come through marriage. Perhaps, happiness to Janie is love. And, as established before, light is happiness. Janie, throughout the book, tries to capture this very light. It will be interesting to see how light is portrayed in the next few images.
