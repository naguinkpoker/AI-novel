            There are many elements. The large, extravagant wedding dress represents "marriage" in the quote. The red sky perhaps suggests turmoil and trouble. The brown, dead grass suggests that the character is in a field. There also seems to be a rainbow in the sky. The novel, however, can provide some greater context to this image. Janie, unhappy with Logan, was considering running away with Jody Starks. Perhaps, the grass not only eludes to the idea that she is eloping to some place far away from her current life but also that her current marriage is dead. The grass does not illuminate the light, thus signaling unhappiness. The lack of a head in the wedding dress speaks to the idea that "marriage did not make love." Janie wanted to love and marriage was quite the opposite of that, thus Janie not being pictured in the wedding dress itself. The rainbow in the sky also speaks to the idea of finding a new opportunity and a new life, something that Janie was doing with Jody Starks. Rainbows illuminate light and Janie was chasing just that.
